Python file for manipulating pre-existing SQLite database

In this file, I will be explaining the prerequisites and methodology of this project. This will help you to navigate through the project and run it, if needed.

### Pre requisites:
1. SQLite Studio
2. Pycharm

### Methodology:
1. First a SQLite3 database was created using SQLite Studio. It has an intuitive GUI that helps in controlling the database, tables and views with ease. A database called MovieTable was created. In that a table called movies was created with the following columns - id, name, actor, actress, yor, director to explain the movie id, movie name, lead actor, lead actress, year of release, and director of the movie are given.
2. Then using the same interface, The table is populated with a few values.
3. After that, using python programming language a program was designed to perform the CRUD operations on the data of the table. 
4. Then the python file was uploaded in this repository.

### Running this project:
1. The files are mainly uploaded in the master branch of the repository. One can download them from that branch.
2. After downloading, run the main.py file with a suitable python interpreter. movieTable.db can be viewed from SQLite Studio. Any changes done and saved through main.py will be reflected on SQLite Studio.
